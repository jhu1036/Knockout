<p> Knockout is a fighting game. The objective of this game is to have 2 players fighting one another. This is a multiplayer game that contains 1 round. When one player gets defeated (when the health hits 0), they lose the game. The goal of the game is to defeat the other player before your health hits 0. To play this game you need to use keyboard. Each player has specific keys. For example, player 1 uses lettered keys while player 2 is numbered keys. The challenges of this game is how the player moves its character; will they dodge the hit or will they react too slow and lose the game? Each character has specific abilities that damages the other player. The player that is getting hit needs to react fast and dodge that hit. Whoevers health hits 0 first will lose and the last one standing wins the round which wins the game. <p>
